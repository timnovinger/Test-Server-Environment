#DESCRIPTION
This script can be used to analyze the environment on a client's server that you don't know anything about. Prettier and easier to read than php_info(). Also does remote IP lookup in an attempt to get the server's location.

#INSTRUCTIONS
FTP the script up to the server and browse to it.
